1)Main function is must
  func mainn-  function main is undeclared in the main package

2)Case sensitive
    func main is not same as func Main
    Println is not same as printLn

3)No need for semi colon after every statement
   fmt.Println("Hello, Dileep ", name)
   var name = "Chakravarthi"

4)Indentation is not required

5)Static declaration of variables
  Once a variable declared in int can't be changed to string.
  fmt.Println(d)
  d=10
  fmt.Println(d)
  will give the following error
  cannot use 10 (untyped int constant) as bool value in assignment

6) := short hand for declaring and initializing a variable.
   var b, c int = 1, 2

7) Go datatypes also have size, when it overflows
  Error: cannot use 9223372036854775808 (untyped int constant) as int64 value in variable declaration (overflows)
  If we add 1 to the limit value at runtime, it will wraparound to 0

8) There are datatypes to handle imaginary parts of the numbers

9) Raw string literals are character sequences between back quotes, often called back ticks.
   Within the quotes, any character will appear just as it is displayed between the back quotes,
   except for the back quote character itself.
